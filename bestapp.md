7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.

These are are very popular ones that everyone knows about so it's logical that they have a lot of ratings.

8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.

Some of these apps are less famous and have a small number of votes.

9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?

The most popular ones are not the ones best rated. This is because a large number of vote has more chance to bring the average rating down. For instance Learn to Speak Spanish Fast With MosaLingua has only 9 votes.

10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?

I decided to lake a subquery to get the top 3 best rated apps for the apps that received at least 30k votes. 

Plants vs. Zombies	5	426463
Plants vs. Zombies HD	5	163598
Flashlight Ⓞ	5	130450


11. Does people care about the price? Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?

To some extent they care about the price. Free apps have 5 times more ratings then paid apps. However, the average rating is a bit higher for paid apps than free ones.
